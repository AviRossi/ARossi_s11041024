- The   working   conceptualization   of    addiction   continues  to  develop  as  emerging  research  across  multidisciplinary  fields  informs  treatment  and  in-tervention  techniques.    While  prevention  efforts  are  often  aimed  at  identifying  the  underlying  causes  of   addiction,  intervention  and  treatment  should  oper-ate  from  a  more  comprehensive  conceptualization  of   addiction  that  is  focused  on  the  mechanisms  of   action  among  three  primary  elements: a)  impaired  neurological  mechanisms;  b)  unmet  psychological  needs; and c) dysfunctional behavior. Thus, the proposed active reinforcement  model  serves  as  a  more  comprehen-sive conceptualization of  addiction that accounts for and  incorporates  all  of   the  elements  of   addiction  and  places  them  in  an  interdependent  context  that  may  be  more  effective  in  generating  successful  ad-diction  treatment  outcomes  than  previous  models.

 - It is clear that many research paradigms are insular and inadequate in explaining addiction. Addiction is a multi-faceted behaviour that is strongly
influenced by contextual factors which cannot be encompassed by any single theoretical perspective. These factors include variations in behavioural
involvement and motivation across different demographic groups, structural
characteristics of activities/substances, and the developmental or temporal
nature of addictive behaviour. Research and clinical interventions are best
served by a biopsychosocial approach that incorporates the best strands of
contemporary psychology, biology and sociology.

 - The biopsychosocial model of addiction posits that
biological/genetic, psychological, and sociocultural
factors contribute to substance use and all must be taken
into consideration in prevention and treatment efforts. This model emerged in response to criticisms of the
biomedical model, which has historically dominated
the field of addiction studies. On the other hand, the traditional biomedical
model was developed and is espoused by medical scientists for the study of disease, and its proponents also
view addiction as a chronically relapsing brain disease
with a genetic/biochemical cause.The biomedical or
disease model of addiction views addiction as the manifestation of disturbances in measurable biochemical or
neurophysiological processes in the afflicted individual.

- The 34 included studies were predominantly quantitative and conducted in the USA. Among mixed findings of treatment providers’ support for the DMA, strong validity studies indicated treatment providers supported the disease concept and moral, free-will or social models simultaneously. Support for the DMA was positively associated with treatment providers’ age, year of qualification, certification status, religious beliefs, being in recovery and Alcoholics Anonymous attendance. Greater education was negatively associated with DMA support. Treatment providers identified potential positive (e.g. reduced stigma) and negative (e.g. increased sense of helplessness) impacts of the DMA on client behaviour.
